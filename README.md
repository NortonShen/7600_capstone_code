## The code is divided into four parts:

- 7600_code_LSTM_part.ipynb
- 7600_code_GRU&SRU_part.ipynb
- 7600_code_XGB_part.ipynb
- 7600_code_ARIMA_part.ipynb

After variable selection using XGB, fitting is done using LSTM, Bi-LSTM, CNN-LSTM, GRU, SRU, and ARIMA for comparison.

All fitting and prediction results summaries are included in `7600_summary.ipynb` and `multi_step_prediction.ipynb`.
